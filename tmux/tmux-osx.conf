# mouse behavior
# NOTE: This is for Tmux >= 2.1! They changed the API.
# It is set here as Homebrew has Tmux 2.1+ and, currently,
# the DNF (I use this for Fedora Linux) only has 2.0.
set -g mouse on


# NOTE: It is rumored that the pasting issue with tmux
# is fixed in Yosemite+, so I'm not sure reattach-to-user-namespace
# is needed anymore. Should check that before renabling the following,
# and note that I moved some of these into the man config file (Vim-like buffer stuff)
# Setup 'v' to begin selection as in Vim
# bind-key -t vi-copy v begin-selection
# bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"

# Update default binding of `Enter` to also use copy-pipe
# unbind -t vi-copy Enter
# bind-key -t vi-copy Enter copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"

# Enable native Mac OS X copy/paste
#set-option -g default-command "/bin/bash -c 'which reattach-to-user-namespace >/dev/null && exec reattach-to-user-namespace $SHELL -l || exec $SHELL -l'"
# set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh"
