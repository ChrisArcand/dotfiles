# Chris Arcand's dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

These dotfiles contain my own configurations for git, Sublime Text, and zsh as well as
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
and modified vim/tmux configurations from [Maximum Awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome).

## Install

    rake

### vim (Maximum Awesome bindings)

* `,d` brings up [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), a sidebar buffer for navigating and manipulating files
* `,t` brings up [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim), a project file filter for easily opening specific files
* `,b` restricts ctrlp.vim to open buffers
* `,a` starts project search with [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) using [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (like ack)
* `ds`/`cs` delete/change surrounding characters (e.g. `"Hey!"` + `ds"` = `Hey!`, `"Hey!"` + `cs"'` = `'Hey!'`) with [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* `\\\` toggles current line comment
* `\\` toggles visual selection comment lines
* `vii`/`vai` visually select *in* or *around* the cursor's indent
* `,[space]` strips trailing whitespace
* `<C-]>` jump to definition using ctags
* `,l` begins aligning lines on a string, usually used as `,l=` to align assignments
* `<C-hjkl>` move between windows, shorthand for `<C-w> hjkl`

### tmux (Maximum Awesome bindings)

* `<C-a>` is the prefix
* mouse scroll initiates tmux scroll
* `prefix v` makes a vertical split
* `prefix s` makes a horizontal split

If you have three or more panes:
* `prefix +` opens up the main-horizontal-layout
* `prefix =` opens up the main-vertical-layout

You can adjust the size of the smaller panes in `tmux.conf` by lowering or increasing the `other-pane-height` and `other-pane-width` options.

## Uninstall

    rake uninstall

Note that this won't remove everything, but your vim configuration should be reset to whatever it was before installing. Some uninstallation steps will be manual.
